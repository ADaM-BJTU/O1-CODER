On the very first day of their cooking sessions, to identify the cooking abilities of each junior chef, Chef instructed them to make their premier dishes. The junior chefs were very excited and they all went into the kitchen to cook their dishes.\n\nChef has a limited number of jars in the kitchen. The jars are magical ― if a chef that is cooking a dish requiring $x$ ingredients takes $x$ jars, each of these jars fills itself with one of the required ingredients, and after this chef finishes cooking and returns the jars to the kitchen, they empty themselves (and are ready for other chefs to take some or all of them). Of course, this means it is impossible to cook a dish requiring $x$ ingredients with less than $x$ jars.\n\nSince Chef did not tell the junior chefs in which order they should prepare their dishes, they started picking up jars simultaneously and in the end, no junior chef was able to acquire enough jars to prepare their premier dish. Also, none of the junior chefs are willing to lend their jars to others. Chef was unable to handle the situation and decided to call off the cooking session for that day, so that he could get more jars and try it again later.\n\nYou know that there are $N$ junior chefs (numbered $1$ through $N$) and for each valid $i$, the number of ingredients required for the dish of the $i$-th chef is $A_{i}$. If there are $J$ jars, then formally, the following process happens:\nThe junior chefs take some jars; let's denote the number of jars taken by the $i$-th chef by $a_{i}$. Any distribution of jars such that $0 ≤ a_{i}$ for each valid $i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^N a_{i} = J$ is possible.\nAt any time, if $a_{i} < A_{i}$ for each chef $i$ that has not prepared their dish yet, the cooking session is a failure.\nOtherwise, one of the chefs who have at least as many jars as the number of required ingredients prepares their dish and returns their jars to the kitchen.\nWhenever some jars are returned to the kitchen, they are immediately taken by some chefs that have not prepared their dishes yet (possibly all the jars by one chef).\nThis process continues with chefs taking jars, cooking their dishes and returning jars, until no chef can cook their dish anymore or all chefs have cooked their dishes.\nWhen all junior chefs have successfully cooked their dishes, the cooking session ends successfully.\n\nChef wants to know the minimum number of magical jars that should be present in the kitchen initially so that the session would be successful regardless of how the junior chefs pick up the jars. Chef is a legendary cook, but he is not very good at mathematics, so he asks you to find that number.\n\n------  Input ------\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

        "prompt": "Please refer to the given task description and provide a thought process in the form of step-by-step pseudocode refinement.\n\nA curious user has approached you with a programming question. You should give step-by-step solutions to the user's questions. For each step you can choose one of the following three actions：\n<Action 1> Defining Function Structures Using pseudocode\n<Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode\n<Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode\n\n## Structure Guidelines:\n1. Please note that the pseudocode should be detailed and provide a step-by-step solution. Each step should logically build upon the previous one, moving from high-level structure to detailed implementation.\n2. Each step should follow the format: \"Step x: <Action y>...\" (where x is the step number and <Action y> is one of the specified actions).\n3. The pseudocode should be presented in the format: \"[Pseudo Start]<PSEUDOCODE>[Pseudo End]\".\n4. At the final step, provide the complete Python code in this format: \"The code is: [Code Start]<CODE>[Code End].\" Here, <CODE> should contain a working Python code based on the final pseudocode, and it must be enclosed within Python code block syntax.\n\n## Notes\n1. Aim to break down the solution into as many detailed, intermediate steps as possible while ensuring logical coherence between steps and avoiding unnecessary redundancy.\n2. The Python code solution should match the input and output requirements as described in the question. This means the solution may use terminal I/O for inputs and outputs, or it may require function parameters and return values. Carefully review the question's description to determine the expected code structure, and ensure there are no input/output format errors.\n3. Gradually refine each functional part of the pseudocode, breaking down complex operations into manageable steps.\n4. Transition to Python code only once all parts of the pseudocode have been fully refined.\n6. Do not generate content unrelated to the answer or any other explanations.\n\nNow, with the problem description provided below, you need to provide or complete a full, step-by-step solution according to the previous explanations. **If the 'Solution' section is empty, please directly provide a complete, step-by-step solution.

On the very first day of their cooking sessions, to identify the cooking abilities of each junior chef, Chef instructed them to make their premier dishes. The junior chefs were very excited and they all went into the kitchen to cook their dishes.\n\nChef has a limited number of jars in the kitchen. The jars are magical ― if a chef that is cooking a dish requiring $x$ ingredients takes $x$ jars, each of these jars fills itself with one of the required ingredients, and after this chef finishes cooking and returns the jars to the kitchen, they empty themselves (and are ready for other chefs to take some or all of them). Of course, this means it is impossible to cook a dish requiring $x$ ingredients with less than $x$ jars.\n\nSince Chef did not tell the junior chefs in which order they should prepare their dishes, they started picking up jars simultaneously and in the end, no junior chef was able to acquire enough jars to prepare their premier dish.
