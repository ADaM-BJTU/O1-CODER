        "prompt": "Please refer to the given task description and provide a thought process in the form of step-by-step pseudocode refinement.\n\nA curious user has approached you with a programming question. You should give step-by-step solutions to the user's questions. For each step you can choose one of the following three actions：\n<Action 1> Defining Function Structures Using pseudocode\n<Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode\n<Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode\n\n## Structure Guidelines:\n1. Please note that the pseudocode should be detailed and provide a step-by-step solution. Each step should logically build upon the previous one, moving from high-level structure to detailed implementation.\n2. Each step should follow the format: \"Step x: <Action y>...\" (where x is the step number and <Action y> is one of the specified actions).\n3. The pseudocode should be presented in the format: \"[Pseudo Start]<PSEUDOCODE>[Pseudo End]\".\n4. At the final step, provide the complete Python code in this format: \"The code is: [Code Start]<CODE>[Code End].\" Here, <CODE> should contain a working Python code based on the final pseudocode, and it must be enclosed within Python code block syntax.\n\n## Notes\n1. Aim to break down the solution into as many detailed, intermediate steps as possible while ensuring logical coherence between steps and avoiding unnecessary redundancy.\n2. The Python code solution should match the input and output requirements as described in the question. This means the solution may use terminal I/O for inputs and outputs, or it may require function parameters and return values. Carefully review the question's description to determine the expected code structure, and ensure there are no input/output format errors.\n3. Gradually refine each functional part of the pseudocode, breaking down complex operations into manageable steps.\n4. Transition to Python code only once all parts of the pseudocode have been fully refined.\n6. Do not generate content unrelated to the answer or any other explanations.\n\nNow, with the problem description provided below, you need to provide or complete a full, step-by-step solution according to the previous explanations. **If the 'Solution' section is empty, please directly provide a complete, step-by-step solution. If it is not empty, do not repeat or rephrase existing content; simply continue from where it left off to complete the solution.**\n### Description\nFrom the childhood we are taught that a comes before b then b comes before c and so on.So whenever we try to sort any given string we sort it in that manner only placing a before b and so on.But what happens if we initially change the pattern of sorting .This question arrived in Arav's  young mind. He thought what would the final string be like if z comes before a and a comes after c and so on. He got really puzzled in finding out the final sorted string.So he asks you for help.\n\nHe gives you two strings.One the pattern string P which decides the order of alphabets and the second that is the final string F which needs to be sorted. Help him by telling him the final sorted string.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains the pattern string P indicating the relative ordering of alphabets and the second line contains the final string F to be sorted.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint T lines where each line contains the sorted string.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 ≤  T ≤ 10    \n\n|P| = 26\n\n1 ≤ |F| ≤ 10^5\n\nBoth the string consists only of  characters 'a'-'z'.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n2\nwcyuogmlrdfphitxjakqvzbnes\njcdokai\nmiruqopsxthzdcnvkfbglwayje\nwgfsyvno\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\ncodijak\nosnvfgwy\n\n### Solution\n",
