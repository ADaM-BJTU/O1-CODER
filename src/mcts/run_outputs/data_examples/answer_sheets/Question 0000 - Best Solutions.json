There is no need to worry about uppercase vowels in this kata.\n\n**Step 2:** Now create a function called `decode()` to turn the numbers back into vowels according to the same pattern shown above.\n\nFor example, `decode(\"h3 th2r2\")` would return `\"hi there\"`.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you can assume that any numbers passed into the function will correspond to vowels.",

                "1": "### Step 1: **Defining High-Level Structure for `encode()` and `decode()` (Action 1)**\n\nIn this first step, we define the overall structure of both the `encode()` and `decode()` functions. The goal of the `encode()` function is to replace vowels in the string with their respective numbers, while the `decode()` function will reverse this process, converting numbers back into the corresponding vowels.\n\n#### Plan for `encode()`:\n1. Loop through each character in the input string.\n2. For each lowercase vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), replace it with the corresponding number (`a -> 1`, `e -> 2`, etc.).\n3. Keep all other characters (non-vowels) unchanged.\n\n#### Plan for `decode()`:\n1. Loop through each character in the input string.\n2. For each number (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`), replace it with the corresponding vowel (`1 -> a`, `2 -> e`, etc.).\n3. Keep all other characters (non-numeric) unchanged.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction encode(string):\n    Initialize a dictionary for vowel to number mappings\n    Initialize an empty string for the result\n    For each character in the string:\n        If the character is a vowel:\n            Append the corresponding number to the result\n        Else:\n            Append the character as is\n    Return the result string\n\nFunction decode(string):\n    Initialize a dictionary for number to vowel mappings\n    Initialize an empty string for the result\n    For each character in the string:\n        If the character is a number:\n            Append the corresponding vowel to the result\n        Else:\n            Append the character as is\n    Return the result string\n```\n\n",
                "2": "### Step 2: **Refine the `encode()` Function (Action 2)**\n\nIn this step, we will refine the pseudocode for the `encode()` function by detailing how to handle each character in the input string and map vowels to numbers. This includes the setup of the dictionary for encoding and the loop to process each character.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction encode(string):\n    Initialize a dictionary `vowel_to_number` with mappings: {'a': '1', 'e': '2', 'i': '3', 'o': '4', 'u': '5'}\n    Initialize an empty string `encoded_string` to store the result\n    For each character `char` in the input `string`:\n        If `char` is in `vowel_to_number`:\n            Append `vowel_to_number[char]` to `encoded_string`\n        Else:\n            Append `char` to `encoded_string`\n    Return `encoded_string`\n```\n\n#### Reasoning:\n- We use a dictionary to efficiently map each vowel to its corresponding number.\n- For each character in the string, we check if it's a vowel by looking it up in the dictionary.\n- If it's a vowel, we append the mapped number to the result string.\n- If it's not a vowel, we append the character as is to maintain the integrity of non-vowel characters.",
                "3": "### Step 3: **Refine the `decode()` Function (Action 2)**\n\nIn this step, we refine the pseudocode for the `decode()` function. The goal is to handle the process of replacing numbers with the corresponding vowels. We will establish a dictionary for number-to-vowel mappings and refine the logic for parsing through the string.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction decode(string):\n    Initialize a dictionary `number_to_vowel` with mappings: {'1': 'a', '2': 'e', '3': 'i', '4': 'o', '5': 'u'}\n    Initialize an empty string `decoded_string` to store the result\n    For each character `char` in the input `string`:\n        If `char` is in `number_to_vowel`:\n            Append `number_to_vowel[char]` to `decoded_string`\n        Else:\n            Append `char` to `decoded_string`\n    Return `decoded_string`\n```\n\n#### Reasoning:\n- We create a dictionary `number_to_vowel` to map each number (1-5) back to its respective vowel.\n- For each character in the string, we check if it's a number (1-5) by looking it up in the dictionary.\n- If it's a number, we append the corresponding vowel to the result string.\n- If it's not a number (e.g., spaces or other characters), we simply append it as is.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly reverse the encoding process, replacing numbers with vowels while maintaining the integrity of non-numeric characters.\n\n",
                "4": "### Step 4: **Generating Python Code for `encode()` and `decode()` (Action 3)**\n\nNow that the pseudocode for both `encode()` and `decode()` functions has been fully refined, we translate it into Python code. This involves implementing the logic for both encoding vowels as numbers and decoding numbers back into vowels.\n\n#### Python Code:\n```python\ndef encode(string):\n    # Mapping from vowels to numbers\n    vowel_to_number = {'a': '1', 'e': '2', 'i': '3', 'o': '4', 'u': '5'}\n    # String to store encoded result\n    encoded_string = \"\"\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in string:\n        # Check if the character is a vowel and map it to the corresponding number\n        if char in vowel_to_number:\n            encoded_string += vowel_to_number[char]\n        else:\n            # Keep non-vowel characters unchanged\n            encoded_string += char\n    return encoded_string\n\ndef decode(string):\n    # Mapping from numbers to vowels\n    number_to_vowel = {'1': 'a', '2': 'e', '3': 'i', '4': 'o', '5': 'u'}\n    # String to store decoded result\n    decoded_string = \"\"\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in string:\n        # Check if the character is a number and map it to the corresponding vowel\n        if char in number_to_vowel:\n            decoded_string += number_to_vowel[char]\n        else:\n            # Keep non-numeric characters unchanged\n            decoded_string += char\n    return decoded_string\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(encode(\"hello\"))  # Output: \"h2ll4\"\nprint(decode(\"h3 th2r2\"))  # Output: \"hi there\"\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- For the `encode()` function, we create a dictionary `vowel_to_number` to map vowels to numbers. We iterate over each character in the input string, replacing vowels with their corresponding numbers and keeping other characters unchanged.\n- For the `decode()` function, we create a dictionary `number_to_vowel` to map numbers back to vowels. We iterate over each character in the input string, replacing numbers with their corresponding vowels and keeping other characters unchanged.\n- The code is efficient and straightforward, utilizing dictionary lookups to perform the necessary character replacements.\n\nThis completes the translation of the refined pseudocode into Python, providing a functional implementation of the `encode()` and `decode()` operations."
